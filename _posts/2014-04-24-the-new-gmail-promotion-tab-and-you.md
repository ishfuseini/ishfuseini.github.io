Google has recently introduced another change to the [Promotions Tab](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-new-more-visual-way-to-view-your.html)

To engage your recpients in the past, your best first impression would come from your From Name, Subject Line and Preheader text. With the new change in gmail, there has been a shift to focus more on imagery.

Litmus has written [a great primer](https://litmus.com/blog/gmail-does-it-again-the-new-visual-promotions-tab) on customizing the promotional images using schemas.

Without the custom code, Google tries its best to select an appropriate image to use. We haven&#8217;t implemented schemas in our promotional emails. Here is how our emails are currently looking in the Promotions tab.

Here are a few things I noticed about how our Timberwolves emails appear.

#### Imagery looks great {#imagerylooksgreat}

We have access to high quality photos and I believe we do a great job of using imagery in our emails to drive action.

#### Lack of calls to action {#lackofcallstoaction}

While we do use images well, they are nearly almost devoid of a Call To Action. This is something we&#8217;ll need to test. For offers like our 40% off Merchandise, discount details in the image might have worked to our advantage.

## Who is affected? {#whoisaffected}

I need to figure out if I need to generate schemas for Promotional emails. In order to do this, I need to get a breakdown of domains in our database.

Here are the top 10 Domains:

#### Gmail is #2! {#gmailis2}

In order to be more effective with our Gmail recpients. I should **absolutely** invest in putitng together the customized Promotion Tab imagery.

How are you adjusting your email marketing with the changes to Gmail Promotional Tab?
