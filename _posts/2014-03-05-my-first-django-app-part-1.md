title: 'Email Workflow &#8211; Solving Headaches'

I am currently working on a project that will help streamline my workflow at work. I am responsible for delivering email marketing communication from many different stakeholders. This ends up in a volley of emails with various changes from different stakeholders.

I thought a simpler solution would have the stakeholders put their copy into an app that would preview the email for them.

I recently went through Learn Python the Hard Way and a (quick) run through of Tango with Django. So I thought I would dive in an build this application.

With a help of a friend, I put some models together of the app and a small workflow.

Here is what I&#8217;ve accomplished so far:

  * Templates with the help of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/)

  * User Registration using [django-registration](https://django-registration.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

  * Email sends with [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com/)

Next I&#8217;ll be tackling form processing and introducing a WYSIWG in order to complete the HTML for an email.

Any tips or suggestions are welcome ðŸ™‚
